      <h2 style="color: #800080;">21st-Century Skills and Future-Focused Learning</h2>
      <p>At Winchester Ridge Primary School, we are committed to preparing learners for the demands of the 21st century. Our small class sizes enable teachers to provide individual attention, creating a nurturing environment where each learner can thrive.</p>
      
      <p>Our educational approach includes project-based learning, encouraging creativity, collaboration, and independent thinking. These essential skills empower learners to succeed not just academically, but in life beyond the classroom.</p>
      
      <p>To support this forward-thinking approach, our learners also benefit from using tablets in class. These devices serve as powerful tools for research, interactive learning, and collaboration. While some schools may include tablets in their school fees, at ours, they are typically optional — allowing flexibility between digital tools and traditional textbooks.</p>
